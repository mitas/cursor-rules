# Rules Synchronization Overview

## Context

- The apply-rules.sh script is used to download rules to target directories
- The script maintains a central list of all rules that should be downloaded
- Synchronization between actual rules and this list is critical for consistency
- Overview rules are treated as an exception to this synchronization requirement

## Critical rules

- Every time a new rule is created, it MUST be added to the RULES array in apply-rules.sh
- Every time a rule is deleted, it MUST be removed from the RULES array in apply-rules.sh
- Rules in the overview directory are EXEMPT from this requirement
- Overview rules should NEVER be added to the apply-rules.sh script
- Changes to rules and the script should be committed together
- When modifying the RULES array, follow the existing categorization structure
- Maintain alphabetical ordering within each category section

## Examples

<example type="valid">
# After creating a new rule in core/new-rule.mdc:
# Update apply-rules.sh:

RULES=( # Core rules
"core/coding-principles.mdc"
"core/cursor-rules.mdc"
"core/emoji-usage.mdc"
"core/new-rule.mdc" # Newly added rule

    # Other rule categories follow...

)
</example>

<example type="invalid">
# Creating a new rule in overview/project-description.mdc
# but incorrectly adding it to apply-rules.sh:

RULES=( # Core rules
"core/coding-principles.mdc"
"core/cursor-rules.mdc"
"core/emoji-usage.mdc"

    # Overview rules (INCORRECT - should not be included)
    "overview/project-description.mdc"

    # Other rule categories follow...

)
</example>
